At the time of this writing, SINGE will compile fully under these platforms:

- Debian Linux 9/10 (x86_64)
- Raspbian 9/10 (armv7l)

--------------------------
STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------

- Make sure you have g++, make, and sed installed.

- Install these libraries (with headers) if you don't already have them:

        apt-get install libasound2-dev libcaca-dev libglew-dev libglib2.0-dev libogg-dev \
        libpcre3-dev libpcre32-3 libpng-dev libpng-tools libpulse-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev \
        libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libslang2-dev libvorbis-dev libxi-dev pkg-config

	Providing these requirements:
	SDL 1.2 (tested with 1.2.14, older versions may work fine)
		SDL NOTE:
		To have minimum hardware acceleration, SDL needs to be built with "xv" support.
		"OpenGL" support is also recommended for better hardware acceleration.
	SLD_image
	SDL_ttf
	libfreetype6-dev
	Ogg Vorbis (libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile)
	Zlib
	GLEW

- Now you are ready to compile.

       cd src/vldp2
       ./configure --disable-accel-detect
       make -f Makefile.linux
       cd ../game/singe
       make -f Makefile.linux
       cd ../..
       make

---------------------- LINUX QUESTIONS -------------------------

+ "Can't load VLDP2 library"

Open up a terminal window. Navigate to daphne's main directory and type:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Another way is to copy libvldp2.so and linsinge.so to /usr/lib.

	sudo cp libvldp2.so /usr/lib
	sudo cp libsinge.so /usr/lib
