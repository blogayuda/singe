At the time of this writing, DAPHNE will compile fully under these unix'ish
platforms:
- Ubuntu Linux version 11.04 (x86)
- i386 GNU/Linux (primary platform)
- i386 FreeBSD
- Sparc Solaris (untested)

MAC OSX USERS SHOULD USE THE XCODE PROJ INSIDE THE MACOSX DIRECTORY!!!
The MAC OSX Makefile method is obsolete and is no longer maintained!

--------------------------
STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------

- Make sure you have g++, make, and sed installed.

- Install these libraries (with headers) if you don't already have them:
	SDL 1.2 (tested with 1.2.14, older versions may work fine)
		SDL NOTE:
		To have minimum hardware acceleration, SDL needs to be built with "xv" support.
		"OpenGL" support is also recommended for better hardware acceleration.
	SLD_image
	SDL_ttf
	libfreetype6-dev
	Ogg Vorbis (libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile)
	Zlib
	GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net)

- You will most likely have to convert the source files line endings to Unix format.
Install dos2unix or similar tool for this.

- Now you are ready to compile. Daphne doesn't use the traditional
autoconf/automake nonsense.  Instead, it uses a separate Makefile for
each platform.  To compile under GNU/Linux, open up a termianl window and
type this (from the src directory):

	cp Makefile.vars.linux_x86 Makefile.vars
	make

(You'd do something similar if you were compiling under the other platforms.)

- You also need to compile libvldp2.so which comes with DAPHNE and has its
own set of instructions inside the vldp2 directory. When you get there
type:

	chmod +x configure
	./configure
	make -f Makefile.linux

- If compiling SINGE then you also need to comple libsinge.so separately
before making Daphne. Go to the game/singe folder and type:

make -f Makefile.linux

- Once you got your libraries compiled then return to the main "src"
directory. Begin the compiling process by typing "make".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An alternate way...

Go to the "src" folder and rename the appropriate Makefile.vars.linux_x??
to Makefile.vars. Open up a terminal window and type the following:

	chmod +x buildme.sh
	./buildme.sh


If everything goes correctly it should compile daphne with the vldp2
and singe libraries.


---------------------- LINUX QUESTIONS -------------------------

+ "Can't load VLDP2 library"

Open up a terminal window. Navigate to daphne's main directory and type:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Another way is to copy libvldp2.so and linsinge.so to /usr/lib.

	sudo cp libvldp2.so /usr/lib
	sudo cp libsinge.so /usr/lib

+ Daphne hangs after quitting.

This is a known issue with static singe builds under linux.
Use a dynamic build instead.
